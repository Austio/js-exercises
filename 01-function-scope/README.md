```
node ./01-function-scope/solution.js
1
2
3
```

However, we want it to generate
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

Adjust the problem so that is properly prints out the matrix.

Rules

1.  You cannot chance the variable names (i must stay i)
2.  You cannot change declaration of any variables (vars cannot be change to lets)
3.  Encourage to solve using an iife
